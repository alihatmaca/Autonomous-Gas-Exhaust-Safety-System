# Autonomous-Gas-Exhaust-Safety-System
AI-driven autonomous system for industrial gas safety. Integrates Python (ML) and C++ (Control) to monitor Methane/Ammonia. Uses a Producer-Consumer architecture where Machine Learning predicts threshold breaches, triggering automated exhaust fans to ensure operational safety and proactive risk mitigation.
